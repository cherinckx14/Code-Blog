  <p> The hardest part of completing this assignment for me was working with github and publishing pages because I do not have too much experience with it.</p>
  <p> I learned how to use github a lot better, but already knew all of the HTML involved.</p>
  <p> I did not really need to use outside sources because of my prior experience. I did use the guide linked in the assignment to help with git. </p>

    <p>I found some of the new css that I have not used before pretty challenging. I was not familiar with some of the methods for positioning containers which made it difficult as I applied new knowledge learned in class. I solved it through google searches and looking back on lectures. </p>
    <p>I learned a lot about organizing a web page and all the methods to do so. I also learned new methods for finding fonts through google fonts.</p>
    <p>It was helpful to use websites like W3Schools and past lectures. Some of the questions asked on Piazza also helped when I was stuck on something.</p>
    <p>I had to google the button shadow effect as well as hover effects for certain pieces of text.</p>
    
    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
    <p>It was challenging to implement parts of the javascript, I often found issues that my variables weren't being represented in the way I wanted them to be. For example, I found it difficult to get the input from the user. I solved this by looking through lectures and googling</p>
    <p>I learned a lot about different parts of javascript and reinforced what I learned in class. I did not know too much about javascript before the class.</p>
    <p>It was useful to look back at past lectures as well as google questions I had.</p>
    <p>I googled how to retrieve the information from checkboxes for the filtering of the posts</p>
