  <p> The hardest part of completing this assignment for me was working with github and publishing pages because I do not have too much experience with it.</p>
  <p> I learned how to use github a lot better, but already knew all of the HTML involved.</p>
  <p> I did not really need to use outside sources because of my prior experience. I did use the guide linked in the assignment to help with git. </p>
